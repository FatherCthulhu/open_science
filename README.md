Code drafts for university institutional debts in California state owned colleges

Institutional debts are debts accrued by individuals who navigate institutions and come to owe debts for the services and goods provided. Unlike traditional debts, such as student loan debt, institutional debt is highly fractured, with litte to no monitering of it. Debts can range from as little as $50 to upwards of several thousand. These debts are sought by institutions, who increasingly rely on the state to collect on their behalf through tax garnishments or private debt collection companies. These debts can create holds on students account, resulting in an inabilty to gain access to public services campuses offer.

This repository aims to create a snapshot over time of California higher education instittuional debts across all state owned colleges.

This includes:
116 California Community Colleges (CCC's)
23 California Status Universities (CSU's)
10 University of California Campuses (UC's)

The data is at the institutional level, and as such, cannot identify individual cases of students institutional debts. The data focuses on students at the undergraduate level, ranging from 2018 - 2023, though certain data points are currently limited to single years, noted within the file headers for specific resources. 

The data used in this project has been collected from the following sources:

1. Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System (IPEDS) from the National Center for Educational Statistics
-   https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds

2. Public Records Access Requests Filed With:
- Californias Franchise Tax Board (FTB)
- CCC Chancelors Offices
- CSU Office of the Chancellor
- UC Office of the President
